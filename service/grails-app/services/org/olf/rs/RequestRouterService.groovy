/**
 * Has responsibility for taking a citation and creating a viable list of possible responders given the requesting library preferences. 
 * 
 * This service hides the specific implementations of the configured local request routing strategy
 * this may be a looking in a shared index, a static list of responders or some other strategy. It is REALLY
 * important to keep in mind that we are multi-tenant here. Ordinarily with spring we would configure an implementation
 * and use it directly - here the implementation varies with the tenant, so this class is essentially
 * the pivot which allows one tenant to use the StaticRouter whilst another uses the FOLIO Shared Index Router
